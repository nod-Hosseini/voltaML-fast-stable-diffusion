        """A blocking call that abstracts away the event loop
        initialisation from you.

        If you want more control over the event loop then this
        function should not be used. Use :meth:`start` coroutine
        or :meth:`connect` + :meth:`login`.

        This function also sets up the logging library to make it easier
        for beginners to know what is going on with the library. For more
        advanced users, this can be disabled by passing ``None`` to
        the ``log_handler`` parameter.

        .. warning::

            This function must be the last function to call due to the fact that it
            is blocking. That means that registration of events or anything being
            called after this function call will not execute until it returns.

        Parameters
        -----------
        token: :class:`str`
            The authentication token. Do not prefix this token with
            anything as the library will do it for you.
        reconnect: :class:`bool`
            If we should attempt reconnecting, either due to internet
            failure or a specific failure on Discord's part. Certain
            disconnects that lead to bad state will not be handled (such as
            invalid sharding payloads or bad tokens).
        log_handler: Optional[:class:`logging.Handler`]
            The log handler to use for the library's logger. If this is ``None``
            then the library will not set up anything logging related. Logging
            will still work if ``None`` is passed, though it is your responsibility
            to set it up.

            The default log handler if not provided is :class:`logging.StreamHandler`.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        log_formatter: :class:`logging.Formatter`
            The formatter to use with the given log handler. If not provided then it
            defaults to a colour based logging formatter (if available).

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        log_level: :class:`int`
            The default log level for the library's logger. This is only applied if the
            ``log_handler`` parameter is not ``None``. Defaults to ``logging.INFO``.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        root_logger: :class:`bool`
            Whether to set up the root logger rather than the library logger.
            By default, only the library logger (``'discord'``) is set up. If this
            is set to ``True`` then the root logger is set up as well.

            Defaults to ``False``.
